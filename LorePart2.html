            The DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree, takes place in the Realm of Shadow and in order for the player to get
            there they need to defeat Radahn in Caelid, and Mohg in his palace underground. The Erdtree casts its 
            light everywhere in the Lands Between, and somewhere there is a shadow which is what the Scadutree is.

        <h4 class="amber-text" id="messmer"> Messmer the Impaler and His Holy Crusade </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            Messmer is Queen Marika's eldest son, and he was cursed with having an eternal flame, and an abyssal 
            serpent within him. Marika knew of Messmer's strategic and combat abilities, so she would send him 
            on a crusade against the Hornsent in the Realm of Shadows. The Hornsent were a group of inhabitants that 
            lived throughout the Land of Shadow. They worshipped  the Crucible, which was the previous religious order 
            that was around before the Golden Order. The Hornsent didn't believe in the Golden Order, which went 
            against Marika's rule. Through this crusade he gained the title "The Impaler". Melina, your companion during 
            the game, is heavily implied to be Messmer's younger sister because of both of their connections to the 
            eternal flame.

        <h4 class="amber-text" id="miquella"> Miquella's Plan to Ascend to Godhood </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            Radahn promised Miquella that if Miquella would become the next God after Marika, he would become his consort.
            However, after his battle with Malenia, the Scarlet Rot corrupted his body, making him more like a wild animal.
            So, Miquella tricked Mohg into kidnapping him to use his body for Radahn to become his new consort. Promised 
            Consort Radahn is the final boss of the DLC, and he is known as one of the most frustrating and hardest bosses
            in souls-like games.
