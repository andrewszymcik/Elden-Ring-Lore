        <h4 class="amber-text" id="nightrein"> Elden Ring: Nightrein </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            Nightrein is the most recent addition to the world of Elden Ring, and it takes place in an alternate dimension compared
            to the original game and its DLC. The NightLord is born from the darkness and destroys the Erdtree before the Shattering 
            happened. The NightLord begins to take over the Lands Between now Limveld and begins to start a new age. This makes Marika
            call out to the eight Nightfarers which are various soldiers, rangers, priests, and more to combat the Night and bring back
            the Golden Order. in the end, the Nightfarers are able to succeed in combating the NightLord to stop his age of stars. This 
            age of stars the Nightlord wanted to create is the same as the ending you get by helping Ranni in the base game.

            Here are some Fun Facts about Elden Ring!
            <ol class="white-text">
                <li> Eating too many dragon hearts from the Dragon Communion can turn you into Magma Wyrm </li>
                <li> The Author of Game of Thrones, George R. R. Martin helped create the story behind Elden Ring </li>
                <li> Sir Gideon Ofnir, has different attacks depending which bosses you defeat before facing him</li>
                <!-- explain the size of The Lands Between -->
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p class="white-text">
            People can eat dragon hearts to gain powers of a dragon like their fire breath, but if a person would consume
            too many they would slowly convert into a magma wyrm. The creator of Elden Ring, Miyazaki, worked with George
            R. R. Martin to help make the story of Elden Ring. Miyazaki even made a weapon that is based upon the world of 
            Game of Thrones. The Grafted Greatsword is one giant sword that looks like the sword throne. Sir Gideon Ofnir is
            another tarnished that you meet during Elden Ring, and he has the same goal as you which is to become the next
            Elden Lord. If you defeat Rykard, Malenia, or Mohg Gideon will have attacks that are based upon the boss's attacks.

        <h4 class="amber-text" id="video"> Further Explaination </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            There are various people who have explained the lore of Elden Ring. The main lore explainer that I think does
            well, is VaatiVidya on YouTube. He has gone into a lot more detail than I have in this explanation. The main 
            content that he does is explaining and interpreting the lore of Elden Ring. If I didn't explain the lore well 
            enough for you, I would recommend a few videos from him to watch.
