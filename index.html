            Queen Marika is the ruler of the Lands Between and one of the most prominent figures in the story. 
            She Created the Erdtree which is a massive tree in the Center of the Lands Between and the Golden Order.
            The Golden Order is the main system of order in the world, and Marika uses the Erdtree to govern over the people. 
            Marika married Godfrey and he became the first Elden Lord. Godfrey was known for his strength and his 
            lion companion Serosh. While in a battle between the Giants in the Mountains north of Leyndell, Godfrey 
            lost his grace and then he and his group were exiled from the Lands Between. Rennala was known as the 
            Queen of the Full Moon and created both the Carian and Glintstone Sorcery. Rennala created Raya Lucaria as 
            a place for people to study and create their own sorceries. To keep peace between Raya Lucaria and 
            Leyndell, Rennala married a royal knight named Radagon. During the Shattering, Marika was looking for a second
            Elden Lord and asked for Radagon to be the next Elden Lord.   
        </p>
        <h6 class="white-text"> Marika and Godfrey's Children: </h6>
        <p class="white-text">
            Godwyn was the first child Marika had, he was known as a strong but kind knight of Leyndell. He was the founder
            of the Dragon Cult and taught others about the lightning incantations. Morgott and Mohg were twins cursed at birth 
            because of their omen birth. Omens are known as a cursed subrace of Commoners or Humans. They are known for the various 
            curved horns throughout their body. Even though they were both shunned by being omens, Morgott was still loyal to his
            mother and the Golden Order. Mohg communed with Formless Mother to create Blood incantations. He also planned to kidnap
            Miquella to use him to become Elden Lord. 
        </p>
        <h6 class="white-text"> Radagon and Rennala's Children: </h6>
        <p class="white-text">
            Both before and during the Shattering, Praetor Rykard rebelled against the Golden Order and found his following in Mt. Gelmir.
            He created his stronghold there, Volcano Manor, and used this area to incite a war against Leyndell. Also, while there he used the
            magma from the volcano to create magma sorceries. While Rykard was at Mt. Gelmir, he found the God-Devouring Serpent who feeds 
            to become stronger. To gain power and to try and achieve godhood, he let the serpent feed on him. Radahn was a master 
            on the battlefield and studied how to use Gravity sorceries to become unmatched. He always looked up to Godfrey and Radagon 
            because of their title of Elden Lord. Princess Ranni studied under her mother to learn about Glinstone and Full Moon sorceries,
            and she learned through this combination how to create Cold sorceries. She also planned with Rykard to steal a piece of the rune of 
            death to kill their half-brother Godwyn.

        <h6 class="white-text"> Marika and Radagon's Children: </h6>
        <p class="white-text">
            Miquella and Malenia were both cursed from birth. Miquella was cursed with eternal youth, while his sister was cursed with Scarlet Rot.
            Scarlet Rot was infected onto the Lands Between from the Outer God of Rot. This god chose Malenia as its vessel to corrupt the world with
            Scarlet Rot. Miquella was determined to figure out a cure for his sister's curse. While trying to work on a cure, Miquella created the Haligtree, 
            which was a second Erdtree in which that it was supposed to take over and become the new Erdtree, but Mohg had other plans for Miquella instead.
            Unfortunately, he was never able to find a permanent cure, but he was able to find two temporary ones, gold and fire, they were both ways to slow 
            down the sickness. Miquella didn't want to burn his sister, so he created gold prosthetics and armor for her. Melina is the player character's 
            companion that helps during the game like leveling the player up. When she was born, she had a vision of the Erdtree being burned and that she would 
            use herself as kindling. Her time of birth is unknown, but throughout the game it's heavily implied she is siblings of Miquella and Malenia.

        <p class="white-text">
            The Greater Will the main god that helps Marika to rule over the Lands Between with the Golden Order and 
            the Elden Ring. To help keep order in the Lands Between, the Greater Will sent down the Elden Beast
            which is a physical embodiment of the Greater Will to keep its influence stable. This all changed when, Godwyn 
            the Golden was slain and killed by the Black Knives. He was killed with a piece of the rune of death. When Godwyn
            died this became to be known as the Night of the Black Knives. Distraught from her child being killed Marika shattered 
            the Elden Ring. After the Elden Ring was shattered, each of Marika's other children got a piece of it. This led to a 
            war called The Shattering which each demigod fought each other to try and gain the whole Elden Ring to become the next 
            Elden Lord. The main critical events that came from the Shattering was that Malenia fought General Radahn in Caelid, 
            and then being gravely wounded from the fight, Malenia's Scarlet Rot curse exploded corrupting both Radahn and Caelid with 
            the Scarlet Rot. While Radahn and Malenia fighting, Mohg kidnapped Miquella from the Haligtree, and Mohg would use Miquella 
            to become the next Elden Lord. Morgott stayed behind in Leyndell to protect the throne from anyone who wasn't worthy. 
            Praetor Rykard started a rebellion against the Golden Order along with Marika. With this traitorous rebellion he was deemed 
            a traitor and given the epithet "The Lord of Blasphemy". Lunar Princess Ranni began her plan to enact the Act of Stars.

        <h4 class="amber-text" id="tarnished"> Chapter 3: The Tarnished </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            The Tarnished are a group of people that were cast out of the Lands Between once their service were not needed anyone.
            Once the Elden Ring was shattered, the tarnished were allowed to come back from the Badlands in the chance one of these 
            Tarnished could become the next Elden Lord. The player character is one of these Tarnished characters, and your goal of the 
            game is to become the next Elden Lord. You travel with Melina and your steed Torrent, to collect the shattered pieces of the 
            Elden Ring from the Demigods to restore the Elden Ring.

        <!-- Explains each of the endings that you can get for Elden Ring -->
        <h4 class="amber-text" id="endings"> Chapter 4: The Endings of Elden Ring </h4>
        <p class="white-text">
            The three main endings of Elden Ring:
            <ol class="white-text">
                <li> Age of fracture </li>
                <li> Age of Stars </li>
                <li> Lord of the Frenzy Flame </li>
            </ol> 
        </p>
        <p class="white-text">
            The Age of fracture is the basic simple ending of Elden Ring where the tarnished restores the Elden Ring, but nothing changes
            in the Golden Order. The world just continues, but nothing really changes. The Age of Stars is an ending where you help out Ranni
            to create a new order, the Dark Moon Age, disconnecting the world from the Greater Will. The Lord of the Frenzy Flame ending is 
            where the player character becomes the vessel for chaos and destroys the world with the Frenzy Flame. This ending comes from the 
            player being able to save Melina from sacrificing herself to burn the Erdtree, however the Frenzy Flame makes the player go mad and 
            you can't control it in the end.
